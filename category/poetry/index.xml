      <title>The Tourist</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a small opening in a coat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glinted a shard of iridescent blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tourist pulled it closer, clearing her throat,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shield from the cold wind that blew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounding a low, ominous whistle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if in taunt or admiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sea, from behind, offered a drizzle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urging her to flaunt His generous creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tourist moved ahead, steadfast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading from a finger lined with the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked through the crowded thoroughfare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each standing still with muffled screams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albeit with pressed shirts and slicked back hair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a requiem for their forsaken dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She reached into her coat and chipped off from an edge;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And offered it to each stationed sentry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who stood there as if bound by a pledge,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a payment for her entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tourist entered the city at last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having added to the finger lined with the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To her, all these cities looked the same;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two stone walls rising on either side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, deserving of all their fame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But none offering a place to hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As often before, she was found by a man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering to make her feel whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She placed a fading blue chip on his hand&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paying her debt with a piece of her soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She walked away, hoping to be alone at last&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding again to the finger lined with her past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might wonder, “What use is it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the soul too much for the feet to carry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why lose yourself to a cause unfit?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To you, I say, it is the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like others, she was born set into motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while the wind howled through each rift&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She rolled ahead like waves of the ocean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While denying herself her own weight to lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with every loss she did outlast&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added to the finger lined with her past.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Old Man&#39;s Tale</title>
      <link>nownowk.github.io/post/the-old-mans-tale/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The old gentleman lifted the glass of champagne in his hand&lt;br&gt;
Carrying with it the honour of being the best man,&lt;br&gt;
“To the lovely couple, I would like to raise a toast&lt;br&gt;
And tell you a story that I find most&lt;br&gt;
Entertaining, but it has nothing to do&lt;br&gt;
With our beloved bride or groom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, as many times before,&lt;br&gt;
I walked out into a forest that began at my door.&lt;br&gt;
For a troubled mind, it was a beautiful sight,&lt;br&gt;
And my aching feet carried me into the white.&lt;br&gt;
The forest would wrap me up in her trees,&lt;br&gt;
Providing a virgin land of undisturbed peace.&lt;br&gt;
But when the clear day became a smoky screen,&lt;br&gt;
I missed, for once, the colours of red and green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the things I could have done,&lt;br&gt;
I abandoned classical notions of “fun”&lt;br&gt;
And chose the path that many dread;&lt;br&gt;
The path that only the vagabonds tread.&lt;br&gt;
The trail was dark, but uncannily pleasant;&lt;br&gt;
Calming, yet chaotic like a raging adolescent.&lt;br&gt;
The moon offered only attention, not love;&lt;br&gt;
She was a lone friend loaned from above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admitted I was lost, as my watch struck eleven.&lt;br&gt;
It was too cold for hell, but it sure wasn&amp;rsquo;t heaven.&lt;br&gt;
The wind carried the call of an unknown beast,&lt;br&gt;
Waiting in the bushes for his Christmas feast.&lt;br&gt;
Finding myself on the ground, I tried to remember why&lt;br&gt;
And before I could look up, something dropped from the sky.&lt;br&gt;
Shivering hard, I closed my eyes shut.&lt;br&gt;
I had come for some peace; this was anything but.&lt;br&gt;
Even so, I could tell it swung around&lt;br&gt;
Waiting, as a forgotten victim, to be found.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lsquo;That was a man’, my brain tried to reaffirm.&lt;br&gt;
‘Of course it was’. But my eyes wouldn&amp;rsquo;t confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of the crippling fear and fatigue,&lt;br&gt;
The man&amp;rsquo;s identity was a cause of intrigue.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe he was someone I had met.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe he just couldn’t outrun his debt.&lt;br&gt;
Or a man of great wisdom and might&lt;br&gt;
Brought to the ground on his greatest flight&lt;br&gt;
Unable to share life&amp;rsquo;s sense of humour&lt;br&gt;
And gone at the dawn of the most vile rumour.&lt;br&gt;
Or maybe just a man tired of his woeful existence&lt;br&gt;
Who declined to offer any further resistance.&lt;br&gt;
Or maybe he just took a fateful drink,&lt;br&gt;
Lost his sacred ability to think,&lt;br&gt;
Thought a rope around his neck suited him best&lt;br&gt;
And allowed gravity to do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d expect me to say I had learnt something by now&lt;br&gt;
About life, its deep meaning and how&lt;br&gt;
It was stupid of me to have stayed on the ground.&lt;br&gt;
But no, I waited till the sun came around.&lt;br&gt;
I opened my eyes as if to look up was a sin&lt;br&gt;
And there he hung, the wax mannequin.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree</title>
      <link>nownowk.github.io/post/banyan-tree/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was once a man, quite old was he,&lt;br&gt;
He spent his day under a Banyan tree.&lt;br&gt;
Men would come, and men would go&lt;br&gt;
Up to twilight, from the cock’s crow.&lt;br&gt;
They came from all walks of life,&lt;br&gt;
Seemingly struck by mental strife.&lt;br&gt;
When they left, they left with a smile,&lt;br&gt;
No wonder he had people waiting in a file.&lt;br&gt;
And I wonder, “So knowledgeable is he,&lt;br&gt;
The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And where would he spend the night in?&lt;br&gt;
For he didn’t seem to have any next of kin.&lt;br&gt;
Back then, I was new to the city,&lt;br&gt;
And so, all this was quite the mystery.&lt;br&gt;
I asked around, and answers I got,&lt;br&gt;
Which were contrary to what I thought.&lt;br&gt;
And I mused, “What a fool he must be,&lt;br&gt;
The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he was an imbecile, he was thrown&lt;br&gt;
Out to the streets, by his very own.&lt;br&gt;
The rest of it is an urban lore,&lt;br&gt;
Bottom line being, he found a door&lt;br&gt;
That fed him well, and made him gain&lt;br&gt;
In health, only to get back on the streets again.&lt;br&gt;
And I ask myself, “What do people see,&lt;br&gt;
In The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atop a pedestal, he sat on a bed,&lt;br&gt;
And so, I couldn’t listen to what he said.&lt;br&gt;
But, I wanted to see what pulled such a crowd&lt;br&gt;
Which made the whole street buzz aloud.&lt;br&gt;
After pushing, pulling, a minor tussle&lt;br&gt;
And two hours of being asked to hustle,&lt;br&gt;
I got to where he was, eventually,&lt;br&gt;
To meet The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All my life, Sir, what have I done?”&lt;br&gt;
“You have done a good job, my son.”&lt;br&gt;
So, I told myself, “This man, here,&lt;br&gt;
He must be a great seer.”&lt;br&gt;
And then, I realized, for whatever I said,&lt;br&gt;
“You’ve done a good job, son; go ahead.”&lt;br&gt;
Looking back - Irrespective of the crowd there,&lt;br&gt;
The locals never did seem to care.&lt;br&gt;
So, let me give you some advice for free,&lt;br&gt;
Don’t fall for The Man Who Sits Under The Banyan Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
